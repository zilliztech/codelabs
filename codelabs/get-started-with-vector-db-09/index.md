# Vector Database 101 - DiskANN and the Vamana Algorithm

## Introduction
Duration: 1

Hey there - welcome back to [Milvus tutorials](https://codelabs.milvus.io/). In the previous tutorial, we did a deep dive into Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah, or Annoy for short. HNSW is a tree-based indexing algorithm that uses random projections to iteratively divide the subspace of . Although Annoy isn't commonly used as an indexing algorithm today, 

In this tutorial, we'll talk about _DiskANN_ - a graph-based vector index that is meant to enable the storage of . This tutorial will
